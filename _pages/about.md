Currently doing a PhD in cardiovascular digital twins. My research interests are an information-theoretic approach to inverse problems and parameter estimation. In my first year, I have already developed a groundbreaking parameter estimation method, by making numerous significant modifications to the unscented Kalman filter. Currently, I am working on the practical implementation of this theoretical advancement to solve real-world clinical problems. 

Current Work 
======
The main body of my current work focuses on the development of parameter estimation techniques for the purpose of personalising 0-dimensional lumped parameter cardiovascular models.
I also do a broad range of additional work to this, which is either related to consultancy or the application of the new methods. 

Modifications to the Unscented Kalman Filter 
------
The unscented Kalman Filter is traditionally used for state estimation for the purpose of control. It is a Bayesian-adjacent method and has been trialled for parameter estimation, but it was ill-conditioned for this use. 
The previous implementation algorithm struggled due to rank-deficiency in the $Pxy$ and $Pyy$ matrices, which makes solving the system uniquely, impossible. This also led to major issues with the stability and performance of the algorithm. 
The modifications provided a 100x performance increase and led to the full practical identifiability of a 10-parameter model from 4 continuous observations. 
The introduction of the Kalman interval \tau_k was the first significant major improvement.
