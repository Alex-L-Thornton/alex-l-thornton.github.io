Currently doing a PhD in cardiovascular digital twins. My research interests are an information-theoretic approach to inverse problems and parameter estimation. In my first year, I have already developed a groundbreaking parameter estimation method, by making numerous significant modifications to the unscented Kalman filter. Currently, I am working on the practical implementation of this theoretical advancement to solve real-world clinical problems.
